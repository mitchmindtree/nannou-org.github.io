<h1>About</h1>

  <p><em>nannou</em> is a collection of code aimed at making it easy for artists to express themselves with simple, fast, reliable, portable code. Whether working on a 12-month laser installation or a 5 minute sketch, this framework aims to give artists easy access to the tools they need.</p>
  <p>The project was started out of a desire for a creative coding framework inspired by Processing, OpenFrameworks and Cinder, but for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>.</p>
  <p>Named after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Pkx37kYf4">this</a></p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide easy, cross-platform access to the things that artists need:</li>
		<li>Windowing &amp; Events (via winit and glutin)</li>
		<li>Audio (via CPAL) Input and output streams. Duplex are not yet supported.</li>
		<li>GUI (via conrod, may switch to a native solution in the future).
		<li>OSC (via <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rosc">rosc</a>)</li>
		<li>Graphics (via <a href="https://crates.io/crates/glium">glium</a>)</li>
		<li>Video</li>
		<li>Geometry</li>
		<li>Lighting &amp; Lasers (DMX, ILDA)</li>
		<li>Use only pure-rust libraries. New users should require nothing more than cargo add nannou and cargo build to get going.</li>
		<li>No unsafe code with the exception of bindings to operating systems or hardware APIs.</li>
		<li>Remove the need to decide between lots of different backends that provide access to the same hardware. Instead, we want to focus on a specific set of backends and make sure that they work well.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Why Rust?</h2>
	<p>Rust is a language that is both highly expressive and blazingly fast. Here are some of the reasons why we choose to use it:</p>

	<li>Super fast, as in <a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp">C and C++ fast</a>.</li>
	<li>A standard package manager that makes it very easy to handle dependencies and share your own projects in seconds.</li>
	<li>Highly portable. Easily build for MacOS, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS and so many others.
	No header files (and no weird linking errors).</li>
	<li>Sum Types and Pattern Matching (and no NULL).</li>
	<li>Local type inference. Only write types where it matters, no need to repeat yourself.
	A more modern, Æ’unctional and expressive style.</li>
	<li>Memory safe and data-race-free! Get your ideas down without the fear of creating pointer spaghetti or segfault time-sinks.</li>
	<li>Immutability by default. Easily distinguish between variables that can change and those that can't at a glance.
	</li>
	<li>Module system resulting in very clean and concise name spaces.</li>
	<li>One of the kindest internet communities we've come across (please visit mozilla's #rust or /r/rust if you're starting out and need any pointers)</li>
